# TruEffect Build A Banner Instructions

You've installed the TruEffect version of Build A Banner.

TruEffect has a specific requirement for delivery of banners. They require a backup image be included in the ZIP file and this backup image needs to have the same base filename as the ZIP file it is contained within.

You will find a "backupImage" directory on the same level as the "dev" directory. In this directory you will need to include your backup image for this banner. You can have *only one* image in the backup directory. The name of your backup image can be anything you want as long as the extension is correct. The Build A Banner workflow will rename your backup image properly when it builds out your banner for delivery.
